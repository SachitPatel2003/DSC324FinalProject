# DSC324FinalProject
## Final Project from DSC 324: Advanced Data Analysis and Regression

This project was done as a final with 3 other classmates for DSC 324 (Advanced Data Analysis and Regression). The dataset used was the NBA Player Stats Dataset for the 2022-2023 NBA regular season. We used multiple analysis techniques across our group to find latent insights within the data.
My significant contributions included:
- Building a regularized LASSO and a relaxed LASSO model with the cleaned dataset after exploratory analysis.
- Cross-checking and validating the relaxed LASSO model with others' work to find overlaps and contextualize the meaning of the LASSO model.
- Coordinating group research lines, summarizing key points from meetings into class-required submission documents or "milestones" in class.
